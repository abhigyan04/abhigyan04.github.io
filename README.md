I am currently pursuing my MSc in High-Performance Graphics and Games Engineering at the University of Leeds, and I am eager to contribute my technical skills, creativity, and passion for game development.
My academic and project experience has provided me with a solid foundation in C++, graphics APIs such as OpenGL and VULKAN, game engine architecture, and advanced rendering techniques. During my coursework, I developed a complete game engine from scratch, contributed to ray tracing implementations, and created animation systems and physics simulations. My MSc thesis involves implementing and evaluating a ray tracing denoiser using NVIDIAâ€™s NRD framework, reflecting my interest in cutting-edge rendering technologies.
Beyond academia, I have developed projects like LETTER SHIFT, a daily puzzle game for mobile and web using Unity 2D, and worked as an AI/ML intern at Stella Stays, where I applied machine learning to real-world challenges. These experiences have honed my problem-solving abilities and reinforced my desire to work in the gaming industry, where technical excellence and creative storytelling converge.
I am excited about opportunities to contribute to a team that shares my enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of interactive experiences. I would welcome the chance to further discuss how I can bring value to you. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Abhigyan Gandhi
