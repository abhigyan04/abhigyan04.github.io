    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Master's student at the University of Leeds specializing in graphics and game programming. My bachelor's degree was in computer science with a minor
      in data science. Having pursued these courses and implemented my learnings through projects and interships, I have deep understanding of core programming 
      concepts, both high and low levels. I love mathematics and working with data and am passionate about gaming which provides me with a range of abilities to
      tackle tasks effectively.
      <br>My interests include real-time rendering, game engine architecture, and simulation physics.
      I’ve worked with OpenGL, VULKAN, C++, Unity 2D, C# and machine learning frameworks using Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m actively seeking roles primarily in game/graphics programming across the industry as well as oppertunities in the machine learing / data science sector.

      </div>

      <p>
        Built a game engine from scratch in C++ with stylized rendering and vehicle and collision physics for our final group project. My main 
        task was handling the physics for the engine which was implemented through Jolt Physics and integrating the audio system for which we used SoLoud.
